# SEO-Optimization-Project

## Description

This is a search engine optimization project for coding bootcamp. After being given some unoptimized code, I identified problems in the HTML and CSS files, including unnecesarry elements and unfinished code. I have cleaned and optimized the code, as well as added and improved upon the functionality of the page, boosting both the page's performace and interactivity.
